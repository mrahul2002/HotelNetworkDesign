# HotelNetworkDesign
The hotel network in Packet Tracer consists of a main router connecting four locations, each with multiple departments like Guest Services, Housekeeping, and Admin. VLANs separate traffic between departments. Servers include DHCP, DNS, web, and file services. Routing protocols (e.g., OSPF) and ACLs ensure secure communication across the network.
